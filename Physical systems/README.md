This directory stores animations I created during my BSc to better understand physical systems.

The "damped_HO.py" file was created for a university project where the behaviour of atoms in a crystal lattice was modelled as damped harmonic oscillations. I later used it in a Lab Report investigating RLC circuits in electronics.
