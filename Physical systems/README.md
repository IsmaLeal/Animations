This directory stores animations I created during my BSc to better understand physical systems.

The "damped_HO.py" file was created for a university project where the behaviour of atoms in a crystal lattice was modelled as damped harmonic oscillations. I later used it in a Lab Report investigating RLC circuits in electronics.

The "vertical-free-fall.py" file is an animation showing how horizontal velocity makes no difference in the rate at which a freely falling object drops. I used it as a tool for teaching physics.
